            Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire
            liability of the Company and any of its suppliers under any
            provision of this Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of the
            foregoing shall be limited to the amount actually paid by You
            through the Service or 100 USD if You haven't purchased anything
            through the Service.
          </p>
          <p>
            To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall
            the Company or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental,
            indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not
            limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other
            information, for business interruption, for personal injury, loss of

            even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or
            limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages,
            which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In
            these states, each party's liability will be limited to the greatest
            extent permitted by law.
          </p>
          <h1>&quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; Disclaimer</h1>

            The Service is provided to You &quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS
            AVAILABLE&quot; and with all faults and defects without warranty of

            Company, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its
            and their respective licensors and service providers, expressly
            disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or
            otherwise, with respect to the Service, including all implied
            warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
            title and non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of
            course of dealing, course of performance, usage or trade practice.
            Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no
            warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind
            that the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended
            results, be compatible or work with any other software,
            applications, systems or services, operate without interruption,
            meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free or
            that any errors or defects can or will be corrected.
          </p>
          <p>
            Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the
            company's provider makes any representation or warranty of any kind,
            express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the
            Service, or the information, content, and materials or products
            included thereon; (ii) that the Service will be uninterrupted or
            error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of
            any information or content provided through the Service; or (iv)
            that the Service, its servers, the content, or e-mails sent from or
            on behalf of the Company are free of viruses, scripts, trojan
            horses, worms, malware, timebombs or other harmful components.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of
            warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a
            consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may
            not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations
            set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent
            enforceable under applicable law.

          <h2>Severability</h2>
          <p>
            If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable or
            invalid, such provision will be changed and interpreted to
            accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent
            possible under applicable law and the remaining provisions will

            Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to
            require performance of an obligation under these Terms shall not
            effect a party's ability to exercise such right or require such
            performance at any time thereafter nor shall the waiver of a breach
            constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.
          </p>
