## Description

The project can be viewed online: [HappyJoyness](https://happy-joyness.com).

The principles I had in mind when building the website:

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.
- **Clean Code Structure**: Built with the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology for scalable and maintainable code.
- **SASS** Preprocessing : CSS written in SASS for better modularity, reusability, and nested syntax.
- **Modern Styling**: Clean, modern design with custom components.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Compatible with modern web browsers.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For semantic structure.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout.
- **SASS**: To manage complex styling with variables, nesting, and mixins.
- **BEM (Block Element Modifier)**: To structure the CSS classes in a reusable and scalable way.
- **Responsive Design**: To ensure optimal viewing on different devices.
